description: This was a beautiful evening with a full moon over the Integration Statue. Few places have better flowers than this area of the Legacy Walk. The Integration Statue highlights diversity at FSU, honoring Maxwell Courtney, the first African American to graduate from FSU; Fred Flowers, the first African American to wear a FSU athletic uniform; and Doby Flowers, Florida State's first African American homecoming princess.
