description: This was a beautiful evening with a sunstar illuminating the Integration Statue. The Integration Statue highlights diversity at FSU, honoring Maxwell Courtney, the first African American to graduate from FSU; Fred Flowers, the first African American to wear a FSU athletic uniform; and Doby Flowers, Florida State's first African American homecoming princess. With times like these, a reminder that equality, diversity, and inclusion are virtues to cherish and celebrate is important.
