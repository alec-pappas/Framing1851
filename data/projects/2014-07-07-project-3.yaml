description: Vires Artes Mores. Strength Skill and Character. These are the words FSU students and alumni live by. These latin words are iconic characteristics of the three torches that make up the FSU insignia. Some beautiful purple flowers seemed like a nice way to fill the frame and draw a viewer's eyes to the FSU motto.
