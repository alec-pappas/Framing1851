description: The Heritage Fountain is a personal favorite. It's positioned front and center to Doak Campbell Stadium and one of the more striking views that FSU has to offer. This makes it a popular place for graduation photos and a frequent spot where I enjoy capturing images throughout the year. This time, some beautiful red flowers surrounding the fountain were just in bloom.
